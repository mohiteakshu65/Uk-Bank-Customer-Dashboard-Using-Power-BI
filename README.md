# Uk-Bank-Customer:   
                 Created a report using UK Bank customer data files. First restored the UK Bank Customer 
Database in SQL server and then Created report in power BI with a Summary page showing the top 
Customer Name and Top Balances Customers with their respective Regions. Added a customer Details 
page showing the customers information in detail and at last the ‘New Customer’ page reflecting the 
details of the each month. We could easily navigate between the pages using Drill through options.
